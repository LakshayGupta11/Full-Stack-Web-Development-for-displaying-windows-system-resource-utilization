### Full-Stack-Web-Development-for-displaying-windows-system-resource-utilization
#Full Stack Web Development Project

#This Full Stack Webpage Development project is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at creating a dynamic and user-friendly web application. The primary objective is to develop an intuitive interface for displaying and monitoring real-time Windows system resource utilization metrics. This initiative integrates diverse technologies to collect, store, and present critical system metrics, including CPU usage, memory consumption, disk usage, and network traffic.
-The project encapsulates a multifaceted approach that encompasses both frontend and backend development paradigms. On the backend, Python's psutil library is leveraged to capture detailed system metrics at regular intervals. These metrics are then stored within a MongoDB database, preserving a historical record of the system's performance over time.
-The frontend component of the project entails the creation of an interactive and visually engaging web interface. It incorporates HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to build a responsive dashboard. The dashboard allows users to specify custom date and time ranges for querying system resource data. Leveraging AJAX requests, the frontend communicates seamlessly with the backend, retrieving and displaying pertinent system metrics based on the user-defined timeframe.
-The architecture facilitates a user-friendly experience, empowering users to analyze system resource utilization efficiently. By inputting specific start and end dates along with corresponding start and end times, users gain access to a detailed tabular representation of system metrics. This includes timestamps, CPU usage percentages, memory utilization, disk usage details, network bytes sent, and received data.
-Moreover, the project aligns with industry-standard practices and principles of full-stack development. It underscores the importance of real-time data visualization and analysis, offering stakeholders valuable insights into the system's performance and aiding in decision-making processes.
-The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize how system administrators and users interact with and comprehend Windows system resource utilization. The interactive dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring and evaluating system performance, providing a comprehensive view of resource utilization patterns over specific time intervals.
-Through this project, the aim is to deliver a robust, user-centric web application that not only showcases technological prowess but also contributes to enhancing the understanding and management of Windows system resources in a user-friendly and accessible manner.
